A db design for *Siirtokarjalaisten tie* data extracted with Kaira-core. Reads json-dataset generated by Kaira-core and creates
a Postgres database.

## Dev environment
* Python 3.5.3 64-bit
* Microsoft Access 2013 or 2016 drivers
* Microsoft Access 2016
* Pyodbc likely has to be downloaded and installed from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyodbc)
* Postgres 9.6.1
* PostGIS bundle for Postgres 9.6
* [PL/Python3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/plpython.html)
* [Postgres ODBC drivers](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/) 


You'll likely need a `~/.pgpass` file which contains something like this for connection:
```
localhost:5432:learning-from-our-past:postgres:<password>
```

Add similar entry for production connection with correct host and passwords. Set rights of the file to the
0600. [Read more about PGPASSFILE ](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-pgpass.html)

## Postgres and Access
To make postgres and Access work better together, at least boolean values require some setup. Refer
to [this](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/24-Using-MS-Access-with-PostgreSQL.html) and [this](http://bahut.alma.ch/2006/04/access-odbc-postgresql-boolean-mess.html) for instructions
how to setup ODBC driver (booleans as char: false, True is -1 to true) and Access ui-setup to show boolean fields as checkboxes.
